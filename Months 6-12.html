	<p>  My Mother is my #1 cheerleader.  She is good at it too.  She knew that this first year was going to have my greatest recovery.  She knew from my doctors that months 6-12 after my accident would be slower than my first six months, but would still be significant.  She also knew that it was critical for my brain recovery to capitalize on this crucial time.  She could also see that my potential gains in cognition were astronomical.  Before my accident, I was a Mechanical Engineer who had good grades (enough to get me a co-op at Toyota) where my focus was primarily on partying.  Frequently, I would tell her about the great laps in memory that I felt.  I could remember hardley studying for cerain classes, and still getting an A or B+ in them.  With this in mind, it almost drove me insane to see that after studying for six hours a day, I was still only able to get C's on exams AT BEST.  I knew that I was recovering, but it was infinitly slower than I was accustomed to.  My amazing Mother could see my frustration, and so she pushed me to solve my problem through college courses.</p>
	<p>  She knew that, even though I couldn't think of it myself right now, I wasnted to push the boundaries of my intellectual capabilities.  I had achieved a B in my online summer business course.  Now it was time to try two in class courses, one of them being an engineering course that I had been taking for a month before I had my accident. </p>
	<p> With this in mind, I took the courses and struggled initially because of the work load.  I continued to study for about six hours every day, and started failing quizzes and exams.</p>
	<p> I was furious at the slowness of my recovery.  I remember working almost this hard when I was an engineer, but I always had a weekend of partying to look forward to.  These weekends were so fun to plan and fun to try and experience anything that I hadn't already experienced. Having a very logical mind, I loved the idea of getting so drunk or high that I would do something that I could never see myself doing sober.  For instance, dancing in front of everyone even though I know that I am no a good dancer. However, at this time, since I couldn't drink or do drugs because it would hurt my recovery, I had no escape from reality.</p>
	<p> Dealing with finding a new outlet has been my toughest obsticle in my recovery.  It has been so hard, because I don't love most common hobies.  I don't love doing the same thing I did yesterday.  What I love, is doing anything I haven't done before.  That is my getting drunk/high on weekends was so appealing to me.  It allowed the possibility of anything happening.  With that gone, I had to find something as ambiguous as that.  The search was maddening. </p>
	<p> My best friend ever, Keegan McKim, was was brief savior.  Studying Biomedical Engineering at the same school as me, eventually wanting to become a doctor, left him little free time.  However, once in a while he would always find time to do something adventurous with me.  They were never dangerous, simply going somewhere that we have never been.  That might sound boring to most people, but to me, it was inline with the unfamiliar activities that I love so much.  He certainly kept me sane. </p>
	<p> Regardless, for the most part, he concluded, that I worried too much."  I did.  In fact, I was so focused on being as smart as I was before the accident (being the old me) that I refused to embrase the current me.  This could have been a good mentallity for my recovery for the most part, until one of the scaries moments in my Mother's life.</p>
	<i><h2><b>Overstressed Dewey</b></h2></i>
	<p> I had physical and occupational therapy appointments in Bar Harbor one weekday.  My Mother was driving and I was the passenger.  Suddenly, I realised that I did not have time to go to these therapys because of the hours of homework I had to do.  I also realised, that If I did these appointments then did my homework, I would have 0 time to do Youtube, or another small outlet to stay sane.  Being logical, I concluded that my cognitive recovery was the most important thing happening in my life.  I did not need physical or occupational therapy because only occupational worked slightly on my brain.  Certainly not as much as a college course. </p>
	<p> I told my Mother about my thought process, and she decided that it was unfair to cancel therapy minutes before they were expecting me.  She told me how they could have scheduled another patient and how I was basically taking their precious time right out of their hands.  She didn't say this, but I imagine that part of her reasoning was on the fact that I was a cognitively disabled boy (seen later after my test with the neurologist), and that if the therapists didn't say that I didn't need them anymore, then I needed them.  My physical therapist, Jess, even had a doctorate, so of course she knew what was best for me. </p>
	<p> As sound as this logic was, I was hyper focused on my cognitive recover, and saw my classes taking precedence over my therapy.</p>
	<p> "Mom, turn around" I yelled! </p>
	<p> Rightfully, she wanted to at least go ask the therapists what they thought.  Being three minutes away from them, she tried to calm me down, and continued driving. </p>
	<p> As she proceeded down the road, I was no course of action other than to scare the living Heavens out of her.  To do this, I unbuckled my seat belt and opened the door, pretending to have the intention of walking out of the moving car.  </p>
	<p> Currently I see the combination of poor decisions I made there, but at the time, it felt crucial to my recovery that I make every one of those decisions. </p>
	<p> After stopping the car and driving me home to my amazing Grandmother's house, I began the process of cooling down.  At the time, in hindsight, I broke down and tried to cry away the obsurd reality of what I just did.  I saw how dangerous that was to my brain, as well as to my amazing Mother.  I couldn't believe my actions.  Luckily, I had my amazing Grandmother, amazing Grandmother (93 years old), superb Aunt and Uncle who ran the cottages that my Grandmother and Grandfather had created outside of her house, and my immaculate Mother to help me hold up his heavy burden I was carrying called cognitive recovery. </p>
	<p> Once I had cried and calmed down, My Mother said how she thought I should drop one of my classes, because the burden of two classes was certainly too much for me.  It took a minute to sink into me, but I had not even thought about dropping a class!  I hadn't known that that was possible!  Suddenly the sky opened over my head, and a calmness took me over.  Now, I only had to study for a few hours a day!  It was such a relief to me, that I could smile again!  I could finally find happiness, instead of holding up this heavy weight over my head.</p>
	<i><h2><b>Winter,2016</b></h2></i>
	<p>Finally, Winter had arrived, and I didn't want to stop my progress.  My Mother was also spurred on my the urgency of recovering as much as possible in that first year.  Therefore, I took a condensed Winter course. </p>
	This course was an entire semester (about four months) condensed into one month.  I had a test every day, even on weekends.  I worked very hard, reading a chapter a day, improving my memory with each passing hour as I remembered that information.  Though it was a maddening amount of work, I stayed progressive because of the goal that I had placed on myself from the beginning.  I was passionate about recovering to the level I was at before my accident.  Even if I fall short, I know that at least I did everything I could during that critical beginning time.  Having done everything that I could, there was no room for disappointment.</p>
	<p> At the end of the winter semester, I was able to aquire my first A in a college course, post accident.  My two other courses had been level 200 courses, and this one was a level 325 course.  I had proven what I had already learned before my accident, that perseverence was strong.  Perhapds, even stronger than success. </p>
