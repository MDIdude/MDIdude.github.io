	<i><h2><b>Acknowlegment</b></h2></i>
	<p>There were four people that made me try as hard as I did to recover.  The first was my Mother.  Like I said, she has been my rock throughout my recovery.  She dedicated her money, and more importantly, her time to my recovery.  She has retired early, so that she only had to be to focus on me.  I think I could have progressed decently without her, but with her, I was able to recovery completely.  She is, and has been, the most important person in my life.</p>
	<p> Now, in no particular order, these three people have mostly been my primary source of motivation.  My Sister, my Brother, and my best friend.  My Brother has been away at medschool, but his updates have allowed me to aspire to be at his cognitive level one day.  </p>
	<p> My sister has always been a very supportive and helpful person.  She is passionate about her life, specifically at becoming a doctor, and at helping everybody she meets.</p>
	<p> My best friend has been also persuing medschool as a Bio Engineer, so his time with me has been understandibly less than I would have liked in an ideal world.  Regardless, his short meetings with me have been numerous, and perfect.  Since I love adventure, He would take me on adventures, almost like we used to do all the time.  Currently, these adventures were much more tame because I was basically his first practice patient to look after, but anything with him was an adventure.  This was emphisised since my day to day life was very dull since I spent 30% of my day with my Mother, 21% working at school, 8% studying outside of school, and 33% sleeping.  That left less than 2 hours to either had some alone time to do whatever I wanted, or adventure.  Even though I had two hours, I couldn't drive, and my mother was hyper vigilant about keeping me safe.  She liked the idea of being doing the same thing every day, because it meant that I would be safe.  I don't blame her.</p>
	<p> In order to show these four people the immense respect and thankfulness I had for them, I mailed them each a package.  I sent them a letter, telling them how much they mean to me.  Then, I bought them each a small, cheap book of 50 things I love about them.  For each person, I customized the book by writing in the blanks that the book provided to bring up old memories I had of us, before and after the accident.  The memories before the accident were still are cloudy and significantly fewer than I would like.  However, the few that I have, are still incredible.  If I had died in 2016, I would go to Heaven happily with those memories in hand.  If they didn't know that before, they do now.  </p>
	<p> I sent those packages exactly a year after my accident.  I know that a lot of people have helped me during my recovery, and I wish that I had the time to send them all something special on the anniversary of my accident.</p>
	<i><h2><b>New Goals</b></h2></i>
	<p>After a year had elapsed, I knew that my primary recovery period had passed.  However, I was very young, so my brain would still recover and develope.  I certainly had until I was twenty five, if not further.  Now that I had basically reached my last goal of doing everything I could think of to recover before a year had passed, I had to think of some new goals.  I thought about these a lot since it is clear that these goals would have to be meaningful and inspiring to me.  After some time, I thought of what my goals would be.</p>
	<p>First, I would pass these Spring courses, and go back to my first school (Rochester Institute of Technology) to see a lot of friends graduate, and start again in the Fall of 2017.  Once I had gotten back to RIT, I would set a new goal to graduate college.  Going from barely being able to eat, to graduating college, would show me that anything is possible through dedication.  Lastly, I set a new career goal.</p>
	<p> No matter my ending major, I want to help the brain injury community recover.  I know that not everyone will recover to the level I did, but I could primarily share ways to motivate them to recover to the best level that their body will allow.  I am not a medical brain injury expert, but having experienced their recover process, and having suceseeded at it, I am passionate that I am more qualified to give advise during their recovery process than a doctor.  That is most likely a fruitless way to approach this situation, but as I have learned, through hard work and perseverence, I WILL find a way to make that dream become reality.  Ask me about it again in five years.</p>
