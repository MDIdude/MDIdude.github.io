	<i><h2><b>Hospital Process in Rochester, New York (2/13/16-4/1/16)</b></h2></i>
	<p> Right after my accident in Rochester, New York, I was sent to Strong Memorial Hospital.  Strong Memorial Hospital is one of the leading trauma hospitals in the nation.  I was very lucky to be nearby such a qualified hospital.  The doctors there where experts.</p>
	<p> The first car that hit me left me with multiple scull fractures.  These head injuries lead to most of my difficulty in the future, but for now, most of my problems arose from the injures that the second vehicle left me with.  These injuries include a (enter name here),which left my pevil separated from itself.  The doctors added an attachment with surgery that kept my pevil conected to itself.  </p>
	<p> Before that surgery, blood began to rush from my pevis at a life threatening rate.  At any other hospital I could have easily lost my life right then and there.  My luck did not end with me surviving the initial accident.  The doctors at Strong Memorial Hospital used a (insert name here) down my pelvic vane and found exactly where the blood was coming from.  After stitching my my whole body, I went into acoma for two weeks. </p>
	<p> Being in coma for three days is bad, but my body knew it needed the healing and used some extra time.  After (insert) I was transfered to Golisano Rehabilitation Hospital.  There, I was visited by my great friends from my college, Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as my family, best friend in the world, and other friends from far away. </p>
	<i><h2><b>Home in Bar Harbor, Maine (Summer, 2016)</b></h2></i>
	<p> Now is when my cognitive issues arose.  I was at in the hospitals from Febuary 13, 2016, until I was released on Aprial 1, 2016.  I don't remember most of my friends visiting.  I only remember bits and peices after about March 18, 2016.  This was only two weeks before I was released.  This means that I do not remember my Sister visiting, my best friend in the world visiting, or the majority of my friends visiting from RIT.  Luckily, there was a pictures taken when everyone came together and saw me at Golissano. </p>
	<p> My biggest blessing in the world isn't my fortunate survival or significant recovery, it is in fact, my Mother, Sarah Clemens.  Upon hearing of my accident, Sarah retired from her job and flew out to see me the day she heard of my accident.  After seeing my cognitive struggles, she didn't treat me differently, or coddle me as a victim.  Instead, she pushed me to overcome my challenges,, and is the main reasons I feel like I recovered so well.  Specifically, She pushed me and saw through my enrollment in an online Summer course at the University of Maine in Orono (close to where we live in Bar Harbor, Maine) where I got a B.  From there, she acted as a phsychiatrist t talk me through the very difficult times. </p>
	<p> The doctors that we saw throughout the process, told me that I would experience my quickest cognitive recovery through the first six months after my accident.  From 6-12 months I would recovery slower, but still significantly.  After a year had past, I would recover very very slowly, a little faster than a regular person at 22 years of age.  After some time, the slow recovery would become daunting, however, being in the accelerated recovery stage of the process, I was very satisfied. </p>
	<p> During that Summer, I would feel like a different person every few days.  I want you to imagine your favorite food.  Imagine tasting it, and thinking, "this tastes like Heaven on Earth."  That was me on, say, a Monday.  Now come Wednesday of that same week.  Imagine having that same food in all it's deliciousness.  When it touches your tounge you want to throw up!  It is the worst thing you have ever tasted, and you are incredibly mad at whoever made you put that terrible entity into your mouth, even if it was your own idea.  How dare they!  It is as if someone had put feses in your mouth and told you it was the best thing you have ever tasted. </p>
	<p> On top of the drastic change in preference I was dealing with, my memory was a whole new demon.  One day I would rejoice as I could fianlly remember somehting you had told me thirty minutes ago!  After a few days, I would rejoice again because I could remember somehting from my class that I had learned yesterday!  This was a big step for me, because I used to be a mechanical engineer at RIT before my accident, and had co-oped at Toyota the Fall before my accident.  I had a much superior memory than I had now, but with hard work, my Mother and I were convinced that I could get my engineering memory back.
	<p> The true face of this obsitle took form in my interaction with a very close girl friend of mine.  She had taveled the 4.5 hours up from her school to see me in the hospital, and has always had my back as I have had hers.  Before my accident, I had valued our friendship in the wrong way, and had wanted more from her.  I had done this in the wrong way, and I perhaps made it even worse after my accident during this first Summer after my accident. </p>
	<p> I told her that I loved her and that nothing is this world mattered to me more than making her happy.  I took the extreme theme of this first conversation to a new level a few days later.  I told her that I didn't love her to the degree that I could speak to her again because I didn't want to fall back into the torment of not wanting to just be her friend in the way she certainly deserved.  Next week I told her than I loved her again, and that I was stupid for saying that I didn't want to talk to her.  She has a fabulous boyfriend that I regrefully said couldn't POSSIBLY treat her as well as I could.  With her help, I realised how extreme I was being, and have tried to redeem myself ever since.  In my opinion, I could never do enough to make up the emotional roller coaster I have out her through, even before that summer.  At least not to my satisfaction.  Regardless, I will try. </p>
	<i><h2><b>Traveling up to Orono, Maine (Fall, 2016)</b></h2></i>
	<p>  During this next step of my recovery, my Mother wanted to help my exponential recovery by moving me from one online course, to two inclass courses.  The trip up to the University of Maine in Orono (my sister's school) was about an hour drive from Bar Harbor.  
	<p>I had made it past that first Summer, and My Mother and I began pushing myself that repair my brain further.  Lumosity helped me a lot.  This was a membership that my Mother bought me to a brain recovery app that I played whenver I had free time.  I coninued to sing like I used to.  This helped a lot with my vocal recovery because my tongue was having difficulty speaking as articulatly as I used to.  My speach was very slurred at the beginning of my recovery, but has slowly gotten better.<p/>
	<p> The doctors all said that doing anything new was great for my brain, as it helped make new "path ways" which were connections in the brain to new things that allowed new information to be processed.  Even things that I had already done before my accident, needed that new introduction.  I'm not just talking about simple things like remembering to doing my homework.  I'm talking about difficult things, like understanding the value of washing my dishes after I had used them.  Almost every single thing that I had taken for granted before my accident, needed to be taught to my brain again. </p>
	<p> With every new day, came a new experience for this post accident Dewey.  My memory was my biggest problem for school, but the biggest problem outside of school was learning these things that I had always taken for granted.  Luckily, I was so young, so there were not too many of these things that I had to relearn.
	<p> Being the kind of person I am, I love to do lots of things, specifically new things.  I get bored very easily, so anything new is appreciated.  Most people say this, however, I think that uncomfortable things as very undervalued! </p>
	<p> I love being uncomfortable, because it allows me a chance to figure out a saw to make it uncomfortable.  Comfortable situations are nice, but too many of them bore me. </p>
	<p> To explain this, I want you to imagine a beautiful ship in a harbor.  It looks beautiful, and it is incredibly comfortable in it's harbor.  It is living the ideal life for a boat right now.  Now imagine it going out to sea.  During it's voyage it encounter a hurricane.  The waves destroy a mast.  It makes it back to the harbor in tattered form.  The ships engineer is excellent and fearless like the captain.  After some time, the boat is repaired and it looks great again in it's harbor.  Maybe not as good as it looked before, but it looks great.  Now, imagine the Queen wanting to go to a new settlement across the ocean.  She goes to pick out a boat, and scans the harbor.  A few boats look very big and sturdy, maybe even more impressive than yours.  However, she choses yours because you she knows that the captain of your ship, and your ship have survived a huricane.  She knows they won't buckle under the pressure of a difficult situation because they have dealt with a very stressful situation before.  Having been through the dificult situation, the ship and the captain are trust worthy.   
	<p> I feel like the ship in that scenario, and I urge you to join me both in that harbor, as well as out in the sea.  Clearly it is not an exact metaphore because ships can't not help eachother during a hurricane.  Just know, that I <i> would </i> help you in the scenario.
	<p> After about six months from my accident (the middle of September), I started noticing my recovery slowing down.  Now, I would notice my memory improve every few weeks, instead of every few days.  I was officially onto my second stage of recovery. </p>
