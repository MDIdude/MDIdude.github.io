	<i><h2><b>Adaptability</b></h2></i>
	<p>Here is a link about how the most important skill anyone can ever make to live a happier and more productive life, is <a HREF=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EHZAQmw2JA> adaptability</a>.</p>
	<p> The link's philosophy on "adaptability," was the foundation of my recovery.  I have just seen this link, but it talks about some of my beliefes very well.</p>
	<p>Certainly, through my recovery, everything took much more time to progress than I would have liked.  Just the same, in life, some terrible things are unavoidable.  Since they are unavoidable, you need to be able to adapt in case they end up that way.  Adapting when they become evident is too late.</p>
	<p>Think about getting hit by a car, then run over by a car.  Some of it is luck, like the car not running over your head.  Luckily, I had prepared for tragetiy before this tragety happened.</p>
	<p> I was never permanently ina  bad neighbor hood, but I constantly though of the being able to over come the worst case scenario.  I didn't worry about it or think of it much, but I knew that if a group of men wanted to hurt me and the future love of my life (I didn't currently have one), that I would want to be able to escape that danger.  I knew that fighting a group of agressive men would be difficult to succeed, but I knew that I needed to at least have the foundation.  I could be strong, have good cario, be able to know the basics of fighting in case I have to fight one guy quickly before I shut a door, know how to throw obsitcles in their way, or rig doors shut by fixing something up to a door.  In order to have all of these skills, I would have to do the following.</p>
	<p>First of all, I would have to have to work out to gain the muscle I needed.  Next, I would need to go on ocassional runs.  Playing sports would also help since my reflexes and physical adaptability would increase.  Along with this physical excercise, I could train in mixed martial arts.  All I would need to do is urge them to protect my head, as I did before my accident, since your head is the most valuable thing in your world, I promise.  If you don't think it is, your head is the only reason you're able to object me.</p>
	<p>  What people call the "runner's high" would make me both happy and addicted to these ectivities after a while.  Once these physical activities propelled me towards my goal, I would need some refxel improvement activities, and some basic intellectual improvement of how objects relate to one another.  The way I would do this is, sports like I was doing, and some video games with friends to increase my reflexed.  Next, I could work at my Uncles, like I did before my accident, to learn about obscure things like how heavy a 2x4 or cinter block are, or how quick it takes to drill in a screw into some wood.  After all of these skills had been achieved, there is no guarantee that a group of aggressive men wouldn't rape me and the love of my life.  However, after these precations, I would be prepared to adapt in case this circumstance arose.  I know from experience, always think anything is possible, because I never thought that I would EVER be run over by a car.</p>
